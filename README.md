Hi! I’m Said, from Casablanca, I’m a Motion & Graphic Designer and currently I’m upskilling myself on Front-end web development. I'm trying to expand/sharpen my skills through working on different projects. Feel free to check them out in my GitHub profile, I am also excited to be part of other creative projects going forward.
